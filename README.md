# Minesweeper Wave Function Collapse

A program that uses a sort of wave function collapse type method to solve minesweeper. Contains submodules, so be sure to clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/larobitrumpet/minesweeper-wfc.git`

## Usage

Use the arrow keys to move arround. Use the numbers 1-8 to change a square to that number, or use 'm' to place a mine. Squares that have not been collapsed show the possible values that square can have. Squares that are safe (have no mines) are highlighted with a red circle.
